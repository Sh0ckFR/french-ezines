# French eZines

This repository is committed to preserving the historic French computer security ezines. While a seldom-discussed subject, this element of the underground computer subculture could be lost and forgotten without a preservation effort. The nature of digital ezines, with its high churn for participants, means it is a community that is not well documented nor explained.

# Important note

The sources have been slightly tweaked for immediate use. And unfortunately, some files have inappropriate or harmful comments/contents, for example, the creation of malicious code or homemade bombs. We urge you not to attempt reproducing these on your own. This is a possible consequence of the era and the ages of the people involved, often kids. This project's sole purpose is to preserve a historical record of writings from the French underground community in the 90s and 2000s. You are solely responsible for executing any binaries from here, even though we are trying to clean up as much as possible.
