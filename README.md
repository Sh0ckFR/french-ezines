# French eZines

French old computer security ezines restored to serve as mirrors. The sources have been slightly tweaked for immediate use.

# Important note

This repository contains malicious code shared by the original authors. Therefore, you are solely responsible for executing any binaries from here, even though we are trying to clean up as much as possible.

Some articles are also sensitive and may mention, for example, the creation of homemade bombs. We urge you not to attempt reproducing these on your own. This project's sole purpose is to preserve a historical record of writings from the French infosec community in the 90s and 2000s.
